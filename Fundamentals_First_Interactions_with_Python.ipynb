    "Imagine you want to go over a list, and apply and print a modification to each item. If you do it one by one, it will take a lot of code an a lot of time. Let's say that you have a list of numbers and you want to know what is the result of each item after elevating each number to the power of two and then subtracting two:\n",
    "1. Let's create a list of numbers from 0 to 20. Python have a very convenient function called `range` to do this:\n",

You can use it to include strings by using `%s`, integers by using `%d`, and floats by using `%f`. The replacing variable have to be put outside of the string after a percentage sign (`%`). There are more advance usages and I will encourage you to check the Python documentation on string formatting, it is very useful!!\n",

    "2. Lists have a method called `append` to append elements at the end of the list\n",

    "You have a list of 10 genes names, a second list with the number of copies of each gene in species _x_, and a new gene and copy count. You want to create a container that would allow you to access the number of gene copies by calling the gene name.

    "**HINT: You will be creating a dictionary of dictionaries**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "1. In a Python console, create a variable called `genes` containing the following gene names: `COI`, `Cytb`, `12S`, `18S`, `IgA`, `A1BG`, `ZZZ3`, `GDF6`, `CNN1`, `MKNK1`.\n",
    "2. Create a second list called `spx_counts` with the following counts (**NOTE: counts are made up**): `1000`, `1000`, `5000`, `500`, `54`, `35`, `564`, `6`, `45`, `68`.\n",
    "3. Create a third list called `spy_counts` with the counts of gene copies for species _y_: `1050`, `1050`, `3452`, `315`, `45`, `45`, `345`, `5`, `78`, `15`.\n",
    "4. Create a tuple with a new pair of gene name and its count for species _x_ called `new_entry`: `('ALPI', 789)`\n",
    "5. The new entry has a mistake, it was not the `ALPI` gene but instead it was the `ALPG` name. Correct it.\n",
    "6. Create a dictionary for each species\n",
    "7. Add the new entry of species _x_ in the appropriate dictionary\n",
    "8. Create a dictionary where the keys are the species names and the values are the dictionaries with the counts\n",
    "9. Print the counts in both species for the gene `CNN1`\n",

    "### Integers\n",
    "As the name classifies this data type is reserved for integer numbers. As you possibly know, integers cannot not have decimal places, as this type of data is discrete. The distinction that Python (and most other programming languages) do between integers and decimals (called floats in python, see below) is that they occupy different amount of memory, and therefore they are different class of objects. However, you can do any mathematical operation using floats and integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floats\n",
    "As you probably already know, float is a data type designated for numbers with decimal places. `1.5` is considered a float, but also `1.0`. Both integers and floats have to be designated **without quotation marks**, otherwise Python will interpret them as strings. To understand this better let's do another exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 3: Checking types in variables\n",
    "Let's imagine you have define some variables and you would like to know their `type`, that is if they are a String, a Float, an Integer, or any other data structure (**NOTE: we will see more about these other data structures in the next section**).\n",

    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 5.5\n",
    "z = '89'\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Now let's use the function `type()` within the `print` function, to print the type of each one:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('x is of type', type(x))\n",
    "print('y is of type', type(y))\n",

    "y is of type <class 'float'>\n",
    "z is of type <class 'str'>\n",

    "print('The sum of x and y is', x + y)\n",

    "You would find that the output is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The sum of x and y is 15.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you probably already guessed, `type` is a python function that will tell you what data type a variable belongs to. What would happen if we try to add `z` to `x` or `y` in the previous example? It will fail as before. However, if the value of a string is an integer or a float, it can be converted to the other two types. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 4: Converting between types\n",
    "Pretend you have the same set of variables than in example 1, that is `x` as `10`, `y` as `5.5` and `z` as `'89'`. Now as you can see `z` is a numerical string, and therefore it can be converted to other types. To do this, we can use the functions `str`, `int`, and `float`, to transform data to strings, integers or floats.\n",

    "1. Let's set the variables again:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 5.5\n",
    "z = '89'\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Using the functions `str()` and `float()` transform the integer (`x`) into a string and a float:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x1 = str(x) # Transform integer into string\n",
    "x2 = float(x) # Trasform integer into float\n",
    "```\n",
